# GCC Hello World Compilation Example

This example generates a basic SCAI Attribute Assertion
about binaries built with gcc, and a SCAI Report with
in-toto Link metadata for the gcc compiler invocation on a
hello-world.c source file.

Assuming you have followed the general setup [instructions](../../README.md#Usage), use the scripts to
run the example:

```
./run-example.sh
```

The resulting metadata will be stored in the `metadata/` directory.
